       "AIMessage(content='<think>\\nOkay, the user is asking what AI is. Let me start by breaking down the term. AI stands for Artificial Intelligence. I should explain that it\\'s a field in computer science focused on creating systems that can perform tasks requiring human-like intelligence. \\n\\nFirst, I need to define the core concept clearly. Maybe mention that it\\'s not just about mimicking humans but enhancing or automating tasks. Then, I should cover the types of AI—narrow AI versus general AI. Narrow AI is what\\'s in use today, like Siri or recommendation systems. General AI is still theoretical.\\n\\nNext, the key technologies involved. Machine Learning is a big part of AI. I should explain that ML allows systems to learn from data without explicit programming. Subfields like deep learning, which uses neural networks, are important here. Also, natural language processing and computer vision are common applications.\\n\\nExamples will help. I can mention real-world uses like image recognition, language translation, autonomous vehicles, and healthcare diagnostics. These make the concept more tangible.\\n\\nIt\\'s also good to touch on the history and current state. AI has been around since the 1950s but has advanced with better data and computing power. Current AI is mostly narrow, not sentient. Ethical considerations are crucial too—bias in data, job displacement, privacy issues. Highlighting these shows a balanced view.\\n\\nI should avoid technical jargon where possible and keep explanations simple. Maybe use analogies, like comparing AI to a student that improves with more practice (learning from data). Also, clarify that AI isn\\'t a single technology but a collection of methods and techniques.\\n\\nWait, did I cover all the main points? Definition, types, technologies, examples, history, ethics? Let me check. Maybe mention the difference between AI and machine learning. Oh right, ML is a subset of AI. That\\'s a common confusion point.\\n\\nAlso, the user might be a beginner, so I need to ensure the explanation isn\\'t too complex. Maybe start with the basics and build up. Use everyday examples they might relate to, like voice assistants or streaming recommendations.\\n\\nAvoid making it too long, but comprehensive. Conclude by emphasizing that AI is a tool with both benefits and challenges, and it\\'s an active area of research and development. That gives a holistic view without overwhelming the user.\\n</think>\\n\\n**Artificial Intelligence (AI)** is a branch of computer science focused on creating systems or machines that can perform tasks typically requiring human intelligence. These tasks include learning, reasoning, problem-solving, perception, language understanding, and decision-making. AI can range from simple rule-based systems to complex, self-learning models that improve over time.\\n\\n### Key Concepts:\\n1. **Types of AI**:\\n   - **Narrow AI (Weak AI)**: Designed for specific tasks (e.g., voice assistants like Siri, recommendation algorithms on Netflix, or image recognition tools). Most current AI systems fall into this category.\\n   - **General AI (Strong AI)**: A theoretical form of AI that can perform *any* intellectual task a human can. It does not yet exist and remains a goal for future research.\\n\\n2. **Core Technologies**:\\n   - **Machine Learning (ML)**: A subset of AI where systems learn patterns from data without being explicitly programmed. For example, ML algorithms can analyze historical data to predict future trends.\\n   - **Deep Learning**: A type of ML that uses neural networks (inspired by the human brain) to process large amounts of data. It powers applications like facial recognition and self-driving cars.\\n   - **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: Enables machines to understand and generate human language (e.g., chatbots, translation tools).\\n   - **Computer Vision**: Allows machines to interpret and analyze visual information (e.g., medical imaging analysis, object detection).\\n\\n3. **Applications**:\\n   - Healthcare (diagnosis, drug discovery)\\n   - Finance (fraud detection, trading algorithms)\\n   - Transportation (autonomous vehicles)\\n   - Customer service (chatbots, virtual assistants)\\n   - Manufacturing (predictive maintenance)\\n\\n4. **How It Works**:\\n   - **Data Input**: Systems are trained using vast datasets.\\n   - **Learning**: Algorithms identify patterns and make decisions based on the data.\\n   - **Adaptation**: Models improve over time with more data and feedback.\\n\\n5. **Ethical and Societal Impacts**:\\n   - **Bias**: AI can inherit biases from training data, leading to unfair outcomes.\\n   - **Privacy**: Data collection for AI raises concerns about user privacy.\\n   - **Job Displacement**: Automation may replace certain jobs but also create new opportunities.\\n   - **Safety and Control**: Ensuring AI systems act ethically and align with human values is a major focus.\\n\\n### History & Evolution:\\n- **1950s–1970s**: Early experiments in logic-based AI (e.g., the \"Dartmouth Conference\" in 1956).\\n- **1980s–1990s**: Expert systems and rule-based AI gained traction.\\n- **2000s–Present**: Explosive growth due to big data, improved computing power, and breakthroughs in deep learning (e.g., AlphaGo, GPT models).\\n\\n### Current State:\\nToday’s AI is **narrow** and **task-specific**. It excels at tasks like playing chess or translating languages but lacks human-like general intelligence. Researchers are actively exploring ways to make AI more adaptable, transparent, and aligned with human goals.\\n\\n### Example:\\nIf you ask a voice assistant to \"play my favorite song,\" it uses NLP to understand your request, accesses your music library data, and plays the song—without human intervention.\\n\\nIn short, AI is a transformative tool that enhances efficiency and innovation but requires careful development to address ethical and societal challenges.', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 1194, 'prompt_tokens': 14, 'total_tokens': 1208, 'completion_time': 2.597941086, 'completion_tokens_details': None, 'prompt_time': 0.000343035, 'prompt_tokens_details': None, 'queue_time': 0.045789521, 'total_time': 2.598284121}, 'model_name': 'qwen/qwen3-32b', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_5cf921caa2', 'service_tier': 'on_demand', 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None, 'model_provider': 'groq'}, id='lc_run--019c2819-2060-7e61-b6ce-f041f30a2f43-0', tool_calls=[], invalid_tool_calls=[], usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 14, 'output_tokens': 1194, 'total_tokens': 1208})"

But I should also mention other options briefly.\n",

      "First, I should outline the basic steps. Install the framework, set up routes for CRUD operations, and explain how to handle requests and responses. Maybe create a simple example like a todo list API. Need to show how to define endpoints with different HTTP methods—GET, POST, PUT, DELETE. Also, include how to run the server and test it with curl or Postman.\n",

      "2. **Request/Response Models**: Pydantic (`BaseModel`) ensures data validation and serialization.\n",
      "3. **Path Parameters**: Use `Path(...)` for parameter descriptions and validation.\n",
      "4. **Error Handling**: Raise `HTTPException` for custom error responses.\n",
      "5. **Documentation**: Auto-generated Swagger UI (`/docs`) for testing endpoints.\n",

      "- Use an ASGI server like **Uvicorn** or **Hypercorn**.\n",

But since the question is straightforward, maybe there's no need. However, sometimes people ask 2+2 as a joke or for other contexts, like in the movie \"21\" where the answer is 3 but it's a trick question. Wait, no, in \"21\" the question is more about probability, not arithmetic. Hmm.\n",

I'll present that and offer further help if needed.\n",
